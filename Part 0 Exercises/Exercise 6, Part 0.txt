note over browser:
Step 0: Empty the Network-tab element of your console with the  âˆ… symbol;
Step 1: When you create a new note it will send only one request to the server;
Step 2: Your POST request contains the new note as JSON-data;
Step 3:The response from the server will be with statuscode 201 created;
Step 4:The command document.getElementById('notes_form') instructs the code to fetch the form element from the page;
Step 4:It also registers an event handler;
Step 5:The event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() to prevent the default handling of form submit.
Step 6:The event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list, rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server.
Step 7: The JavaScript code tells us that the data is to be sent with an HTTP post;
Step 8:Then the data is sent as JSON-string.
